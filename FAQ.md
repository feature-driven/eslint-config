### Are there plans about migrating to eslint-plugin?

At the moment we wanna to use existing solutions for "MVP" linting of FeatureSliced best practices

Later, if we'll make sure that eslint-config is not enough - then we'll migrate to eslint-plugin with compatibility and migration guides of eslint-config users
